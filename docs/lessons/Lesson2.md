## Welcome to Lesson 2

### 1. How to create Issues that are clear and useful
**Why:**
"Issues are a great way to keep track of **tasks**, **enhancements**, and **bugs** for your projects. They’re kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub’s tracker is called Issues, and has its own section in every repository." (From: https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)

**How:**
How to create an issue in github:
- [ ] Navigate to your repository where you want to create a ticket
- https://github.com/
- On the right hand side, you should see a box with "your repositories"
- [ ] Click on your repository of interest
- [ ] Click "issues"
- [ ] Click "New Issue"
- [ ] Write an informative title
- [ ] Write a detailed explanation of your issue
- [ ] Assign someone
- [ ] Add a label
- [ ] Click Submit new issue
