### Organization
Git supports the following types of entities:
- Individuals
- Teams of individuals
- Organizations
- Repositories

The relationships between any combination of these entities is many-to-many, with the nuanced exception of repositories.
Repositories belong either to a single organization or to a single individual; forks of a repository may be set up in other organizations or in other individuals.

### Markdown

```no-highlight
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

### Content
GitHub can store any kind of content, provided it isn't too big. (And now [even this is possible](https://git-lfs.github.com/)).
However, it is more capable for some filetypes than it is for others. Certain filetypes can be viewed 'natively' within the GitHub interface. These are:
- Images: png, jpg, svg
- GEOJSON
- CSV, TSV (note that files named type '.tab' will not render properly in the UI.
- Markdown
- HTML
