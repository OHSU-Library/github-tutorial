### Getting started

GitHub itself isn't much more than a social network like Facebook or Instagram. You build a profile, upload projects to share and connect with other users by "following" their accounts. And while many users store programs and code projects, there's nothing preventing you from keeping text documents or other file types in your project folders to show off. It is capable of storing any file type from text, to structured data, to software. And more features are being added by the day. The real power of Git, however, is less about individuals publishing content (many places can do that, including google docs etc). It is more about that content being easily shared, built upon, and credited in a way that is robust to the realities of distributed collaboration. While the power of GitHub is daunting, you don't actually have to be a blackbelt to gain a lot of benefit from using it. You don't even have to know how to code or use the commandline.

### Organization

Git supports the following types of primary entities:

- **Individual:** A person who contributes to GitHub
- **Repository:** A collection of versioned files
- **Organization:** An entity that may correspond to an actual organization (such as a university) or to a meaningful grouping of repositories. Organizations are like individuals except that they can establish teams.
- **Teams**: A group of individuals assembled by the administrators of an organization. An individual may participate in many teams and organizations, however a team is always bound to a single organization.

- Repositories

The relationships between any combination of these entities is many-to-many, with the nuanced exception of repositories.
Repositories belong *either* to a single organization or to a single *individual*; "forks" of a repository may be set up in other organizations or in other individuals.

### Markdown

```no-highlight
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

### Content

GitHub can store any kind of content, provided it isn't too big. (And now [even this is possible](https://git-lfs.github.com/)).
However, it is more capable for some filetypes than it is for others. Certain filetypes can be viewed 'natively' within the GitHub interface. These are:

- Images: png, jpg, svg
- GEOJSON
- CSV, TSV (note that files named type '.tab' will not render properly in the UI.
- Markdown
- Software code (eg. including json, HTML, xml etc)
- Any of these can also be set up outside of a repository but within your use

### Issues

The GitHub issue tracker is easy to use, fairly lightweight and capable for a lot of the basic project management one would want to do.
This guide is a nice overview: https://guides.github.com/features/issues/
