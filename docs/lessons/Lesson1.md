### Organization
Git supports the following types of entities:
- Individuals
- Teams of individuals
- Organizations
- Repositories

The relationships between any combination of these entities is many-to-many, with the nuanced exception of repositories.
Repositories belong either to a single organization or to a single individual; forks of a repository may be set up in other organizations or in other individuals.

### Markdown

```no-highlight
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~
