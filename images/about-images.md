#About using images in Git/GitHub

Images that are embedded into issues can be dragged and dropped in the GitHub interface, however all other images (eg. in markdown files etc) need to be referenced using a URL (at least as of now). Keeping images in a single directory enables them to be referenced more readily. Sensible file names are highly recommended, preferably without spaces as these are hard to read when encoded.

Eg. 

| encoding needed, wrapping awkward | no encoding needed, wrapping more natural|
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| github-tutorial/images/github%20organizations%20teams%20repos.png | github-tutorial/images/github-organizations-teams-repos.png|

It is possible to reference an image using an external URL, however this can be fragile if the URL changes or could lead to unintended changes. For instance, if you get a picture of the occupant of a political office, you may be caught unaware if the occupant changes and so does your photo. Therefore make your own copies and reference those **unless** 
 - You're  sure that referencing the originals will not end in broken links or surprising content. 
 - Copying the image is prohibited 
 - The images are too large to make copying worth the hassle.
