#About using images in Git/GitHub

Images that are embedded into issues can be dragged and dropped in the GitHub interface, however all other images (eg. in markdown files etc) need to be referenced using a URL (at least as of now). Keeping images in a single directory enables them to be referenced more readily. Sensible file names are highly recommended. It is possible to reference an image using an external URL, however this can be fragile if the URL changes.
