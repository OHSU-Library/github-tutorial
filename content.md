## GIT AND GITHUB
- *Git* is for command line, *GitHub* is the web interface
- 2005 born after spectacular Linux tooling failure
- Cross-platform tooling - Windows, Mac, Linux
- Merge files rather than a “lock and checkout” model
- Non-linear branching model of version control

## VERSION CONTROL
- A system that keeps records of your changes
- Allows for collaborative development
- Allows you to know who made what changes and when
- Allows you to revert any changes and go back to a previous state

## GITHUB FOR DOCUMENTATION
### Pros:
 - Contributions tracked
 - Easily converted into GitHub "pages" (native html web documents)

### Cons:
 - Not quite as fluent as WYSIWYG editing
 - Definitely not a typesetting tool
 - Collaborative editing not quite as fluent as google docs, or even 
 
## GITHUB FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT
### Strengths:
- Free for public repositories
- Transparency fosters higher quality
- Best suited for managing generation, maintenance, deployment of code and documentation (not necessarily better for non-digital-artifact-based projects, like building a giant lego car)
- Curation-suitable https://www.asis.org/rdap/?_ga=1.108925314.1414174343.1479483608
