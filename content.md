## GIT AND GITHUB
- *Git* is for command line, *GitHub* is the web interface
- 2005 born after spectacular Linux tooling failure
- Cross-platform tooling - Windows, Mac, Linux
- Merge files rather than a “lock and checkout” model
- Non-linear branching model of version control

## VERSION CONTROL
- A system that keeps records of your changes
- Allows for collaborative development
- Allows you to know who made what changes and when
- Allows you to revert any changes and go back to a previous state
